Hi Duong

## Chrome Extension Setup Status
- Fixed build configuration:
  - Added custom Vite plugin to copy manifest and icons to dist folder
  - Updated manifest.json to use correct paths for built files
  - Added web_accessible_resources for assets
  - Successfully built the extension with all required files
- Created placeholder SVG icon
- Set up basic extension structure

## Next Steps
- Test the extension in Chrome (should work now with manifest in dist folder)
- Implement popup UI with TailwindCSS
- Implement content script UI with TailwindCSS
- Create proper PNG icons for different sizes (optional)

## Not Done Yet
- Extension testing in Chrome
- Popup UI implementation
- Content script UI implementation
- PNG icons for different sizes (using SVG for now)

## Fixed Issues
- Fixed manifest.json not being copied to dist folder
- Fixed asset paths in manifest.json
- Added web_accessible_resources for assets
- Fixed build configuration to include all necessary files
